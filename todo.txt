- Add references for math resources, like how to do tensor/kroenecker, how to do matrix multiplication, etc
- Add references in general, should probably collect a bunch from other research papers to throw in
- Make language more formal
- Maybe add a section relating things to qiskit and showing how the math works in terms of their representations of circuits
- Sections towards the beginning are more of a tutorial for people new to quantum computing. Sections towards the end should go into our research on error correction, bacon shor,
logical gates, etc
